This is the KDLP P0 semi-autonomous tester!

To run kdlp_test.py, make sure you have a file named
	`tests.json`
located WITHIN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS kdlp_test.py.
To do this, create a copy of `tests-example.json` called `tests.json,`
and put the *ABSOLUTE PATH* to a testing directory of your choosing in the value
field of the entry "${TESTDIR}" which should be under "replacements."

Sections of text used in testing marked ${TESTDIR} will be replaced with whatever
text you put in that entry, so be careful, and make sure you put the ABSOLUTE PATH!!!!!
